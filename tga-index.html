        <p><strong>A MAJOR THEME</strong> in the conference was <em>*Building the right thing*</em>. It is not enough that software works — it must address a real need correctly. How do we ensure that we are building the right thing?</p>

                        <p>Last Winter and Spring, Nokia Siemens Networks researched and developed a new real-time mobile radio network monitoring solution to be used for London Olympics by a major U.K. telecom operator.</p>

                        <p>Immovable deadline called for early and swift UX iterations with light-weight prototypes, continuous collaboration with real end users, and brisk backlog and expectation management, to find an optimal set of features for 1st and 2nd releases - both to be deployed well before the Games.</p>

                        <p>In this presentation we show and tell how we did it, how it turned out, what worked great, what we now regret, and discuss how these lessons could be applied in other time-boxed projects.

                        <p>
                        Highly interactive programming languages provide developers with a remarkable ability to empower their creativity through a unique and highly responsive development process. This can be seen to broadly similar to the differences between the waterfall model and more recent agile approaches yet at an different timescale - that of moments vs minutes, rather than days vs weeks. Programming with an approach which allows one moment to flow frictionlessly to another without having to wait for compile cycles gives the developer a unique HyperAgile workflow which will be examined in detail in this talk.</p>

                        <p>The world is changing, crisis, businesses die, insecurity. Our workplace is changing fast as a consequence. We are asked to change constantly but given no method to do it. We need to have a framework that helps us adapt to the new environment. Agile provides us with a set of values and principles that can help us adapt, but what can we learn from Agile regarding work management? We need to look at the underlying principles of adaptation, how it works and it is already revolutionizing the work place. In this talk we set the road-map for that change and describe a method to get it done.</p>

                        <p>In 2005, when I started as the first functionality architect (or UI designer) at Reaktor, we had a lot of ideas but no experience of how to make UI design and agile methods work together in harmony. Today, tens of projects later, we have a set of established practises which seem to work. And of course we made all kinds of mistakes on the way which you could and should avoid.</p>

                        <p>Business Model Canvas, MVP, Pivot, XLM, continuous deployment. Many terms have been coined by the Lean Startup movement. Most of these practices radically change the way businesses do their job - making them more agile as a result. The idea is to make sure we are building the right thing. But what do I care as as a developer? I've noticed that on a daily basis, many "building the right thing" decisions are made when the team members play the implementation of the design by ear. Many interesting discoveries are often stumbled upon during this process. All of these small decisions have a huge impact on our capability to build and launch new products.</p>
                                                <p>In this talk I will explain why it is important for all the developers to have the "right" mindset. After all they are key people in making sure the ship is sailing in the correct direction at all times. All the small actions taken during the course are counted. I will share real cases, propose solutions and present pitfalls to avoid.</p>

                            One of the best parts of any conference is the coffee breaks. You can meet people interested in similar things and discuss exactly what is important for you, not for the speaker on the stage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Open-space session is a slightly-structured way for getting an extended and productive coffee break-like discussions. Everybody can start discussion on a topic, everybody can join or leave the discussion at any moment.
                        </p>

                            The Fundamental "Rules" of the sessions that happen during OpenSpace conferences are:

                                <li>Whoever shows up is the right group</li>

                                <li>Whenever it starts is the right time</li>
                                <li>When it's over, it's over.</li>
                                <li>Use the 'Law of two feet.' If you feel that you are not contributing or benefiting from a presentation, please feel free to move on to something else.</li>

                        <p>The best user experiences aren't born in your head. They are created through mindful design, user feedback, and iteration. This workshop will introduce and demonstrate two techniques: User Sketching and Paper Prototyping. These two tools will help you gather, analyze, and extract actionalble learning from both user and team feedback, regardless of what stage your product is at. We'll get down and dirty quickly, so bring a pen and be ready to draw!</p>

                        <p>
                        In this hands-on session we will be looking at a rather smelly piece of code which needs a full set of automated tests so that it can be
                        refactored and extended with new functionality. It can be awkward to
                        express high level requirements in code, but in my experience test
                        readability is crucial for those tests being useful and maintainable
                        in the long term. We'll be stepping into the Coding Dojo together,
                        which is a safe place designed for learning, where it doesn’t matter
                        if we make mistakes. In fact all the code will be thrown away
                        afterwards. You should feel free to experiment, try out different

                        <p>
                        We're taking a simple, bounded problem, where the code basically
                        works, and the requirements are largely understood. The idea is to
                        practice your test design and refactoring skills, and have fun doing
                        it. We're trying to provoke that "aha!" experience where you realize
                        how much the tests are helping you understand the requirements and get
                        control of the code. There's a feeling of safety and freedom to
                        refactor then add new functionality, which once you've experienced
                        leaves you wanting more. This session could give you that extra bit of
                        motivation to get going writing good automated tests for your
                        production code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The problem we'll be looking at is the "Gilded Rose" Refactoring Kata,
                        (see https://github.com/emilybache/Refactoring-Katas/tree/master/GildedRose).
                        For this session we'll be focussing on adding good readable tests to
                        the existing code, followed by refactoring leaning on those tests. The
                        Kata is available in various programming languages, including Java,
                        C#, Python and Ruby. You should bring a laptop with your favourite
                        coding environment or IDE installed, or plan to pair with someone.

                        <h3><a href="#ralf">Ralf Kruse</a>: A journey from an idea to a ready to use backlog</h3>
                        <p>A product backlog should reflect our current view on how we want to build our product. Product Backlogs look deceptively simple, but the visible Product Backlog is in fact just the top of the iceberg. The true value lies below the surface and comes out of the communication while creating and working with it. In most cases people start building a backlog using their old mindset, and miss opportunities to identify better ways of building the product. The problem is that the knowhow you need to adopt new ways of working can only partially be gleaned from books: you really have to experience it on your own.</p>
                                                <p>In this hands-on session we will focus on the creation of a product backlog from scratch, to build a backlog collaboratively including its surrounding context of the product. In this session we will:
                                                        <ul>
                                                                <li>start at zero even before defining the idea by discovering the context first,</li>

                                                        </ul>

                        <p>How to understand the creative process if you have a degree in Engineering. Steve Jobs once joked that Engineers think Hollywood writers do their work by drinking beer and telling jokes (and that Hollywood thinks that building software is about writing a check). In reality creating software and creating art are more similar than they are different. The phenomenon of mass market software in the form of entertainment has blurred the lines even further. Making software has become much more like making movies than making machines. There are lessons to be learned from designers, marketers, managers and performers that all developers should learn.</p>

                        <p>I’ll talk about how I’ve found My agile way of testing, by working in rather stiff environments, and also contrast the methods a bit to the more traditional testing practices (which I also used to follow in the beginning of my career).</p>

                        <p>
                        As a seven-year testing consultant, doing almost all of my testing on theoretically complete products, created by mysterious vendors, in avalanche/waterfall projects, I promise that the viewpoint is pretty different than what is the Agile way.</p>

                        <p>For new Agile organizations, deciding what to do next is hard. In only too many cases the problem is made diffuse by old decision and power structures. Is the Product Owner actually more of a Backlog Secretary, regularly clobbered by the loudmouths from Sales &amp; Marketing led by the CEO’s nephew, and occasionally vetoed by Mr. J. Random Senior Vice President? In this presentation, I will introduce the concept of governance in relation to product management, open up a Pandora’s box of interesting questions and show some real data that will knock your socks off.</p>

                        Markus Hjort is a developer turned into a coach/trainer and then back into a developer. At some point he has tipped his toes to field of project management and agile testing too. He has extensive experience in agile methods and has been an active participant in process improvement wherever he has worked. Markus started Coding Dojo events in Finland back in 2005. He is one of the pioneers of the Finnish agile community and speaks frequently at international conferences. Today he is mainly interested in building right things right way while having fun.

                    <p>
                        A programmer for fun since 1984 and for pay since 1991, it wasn't before 2005 that Martin decided to do something about all the failing software projects in the world. Although changing the world one Scrum (or Kanban) project at a time is a good start, Martin is determined to rip up the industrial paradigm by the roots and replace it with something that makes sense in the software industry, preferably before next Friday (which would leave the weekend free). Most astonishingly, this plan has been in place unchanged for half a dozen years now, and must therefore be truly excellent.

                        Sam Aaron is a researcher, software architect and live programmer with a deep fascination surrounding the notion of programming as a form of communication. His previous research and industry work focussed upon the design and implementation of DSLs in order to allow concepts to be communicated and transposed more effectively and efficiently. Currently, Sam leads Improcess, a collaborative research project exploring live interaction patterns between humans and process. This exploration is currently grounded by considering musical contexts and building tools which combine powerful sound synthesis techniques with tactile and linguistic interactive user interfaces to build new forms of musical device with a high capacity for improvisation.

                    <p>
                        Seven year software testing consultant at Qentinel Oy. Highly influenced by the so called Context Driven School of software testing.
                        Studied to be a programmer but have little developer work experience. Instead, pretty much all of my work has been testing or leading testing on Customer side, on software (or pieces of it) that has been created by software vendors. Some would call it Acceptance testing then. Never ever worked in an Agile software project, a lot on different twists of Waterfall model.
                        Have done few public lectures on software testing, "My sorry life as a Tester" as a guest lecturer in Turku University 2011, and "Magile versus Stiff testing" in Turku Agile Day 2012. Also try to keep attending different events and workshops on software testing (e.g. Testing with The Stars in Turku Agile Day, Testaus Osy testing competition in 2011, Testaus Osy Exploratory testing workshops, etc).
