        <p class="intro"><strong>TAMPERE GOES AGILE</strong> is a free and fun agile conference at the heart of Tampere, Finland. It's aimed for professional developers and everyone else working in software development. It will be organized on October 13, 2012.</p>

        <p><strong>A MAJOR THEME</strong> in this year's conference will be <em>*Building the right thing*</em>. It is not enough that software works — it must address a real need correctly. How do we ensure that we are building the right thing?</p>

                        <p>
                        Highly interactive programming languages provide developers with a remarkable ability to empower their creativity through a unique and highly responsive development process. This can be seen to broadly similar to the differences between the waterfall model and more recent agile approaches yet at an different timescale - that of moments vs minutes, rather than days vs weeks. Programming with an approach which allows one moment to flow frictionlessly to another without having to wait for compile cycles gives the developer a unique HyperAgile workflow which will be examined in detail in this talk.</p>

                        In this hands-on session we will be looking at a rather smelly piece of code which needs a full set of automated tests so that it can be
                        refactored and extended with new functionality. It can be awkward to
                        express high level requirements in code, but in my experience test
                        readability is crucial for those tests being useful and maintainable
                        in the long term. We'll be stepping into the Coding Dojo together,
                        which is a safe place designed for learning, where it doesn’t matter
                        if we make mistakes. In fact all the code will be thrown away
                        afterwards. You should feel free to experiment, try out different
                        styles of test, and get feedback from your peers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        We're taking a simple, bounded problem, where the code basically
                        works, and the requirements are largely understood. The idea is to
                        practice your test design and refactoring skills, and have fun doing
                        it. We're trying to provoke that "aha!" experience where you realize
                        how much the tests are helping you understand the requirements and get
                        control of the code. There's a feeling of safety and freedom to
                        refactor then add new functionality, which once you've experienced
                        leaves you wanting more. This session could give you that extra bit of
                        motivation to get going writing good automated tests for your
                        production code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The problem we'll be looking at is the "Gilded Rose" Refactoring Kata,
                        (see https://github.com/emilybache/Refactoring-Katas/tree/master/GildedRose).
                        For this session we'll be focussing on adding good readable tests to
                        the existing code, followed by refactoring leaning on those tests. The
                        Kata is available in various programming languages, including Java,
                        C#, Python and Ruby. You should bring a laptop with your favourite
                        coding environment or IDE installed, or plan to pair with someone.

Although changing the world one Scrum (or Kanban) project at a time is a good start, Martin is determined to rip up the industrial paradigm by the roots and replace it with something that makes sense in the software industry, preferably before next Friday (which would leave the weekend free). Most astonishingly, this plan has been in place unchanged for half a dozen years now, and must therefore be truly excellent.
