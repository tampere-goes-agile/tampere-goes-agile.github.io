                        <p>Scaling Agile methods has become a hot topic recently. Several alternatives are available and large organizations are keen to see how they could make groups of 100+ or 1000+ people to be more agile and deliver as forecasted. But what if we are solving the wrong problem? What if it is not about scaling Agile to fit large projects but scaling projects down to fit Agile? What if we would need to scale the system instead of the method?</p>
						<p>
						This talk shows what are the key reasons for having (too) large organizations. All of them are avoidable and the talk will show some tips and tools to keep organization (or projects) small. In addition to scaling the work down, the talk introduces how to scale the system -- not the method -- in order to achieve desired results.</p>

						<p>Olli-Pekka and Eija Mäkirintala will introduce a mind blowing new approach how to develop your teams’ agile skills fast and efficiently - to learn at the speed of change and have fun.</p>
						<p>Imagine that you could practice different roles and upcoming real life situations without real life consequences. By doing this, you could, for example, test what would be the best way to build trust with a new customer or how to convince him/her about the benefits the characteristics of agile ways of working. All world-class agile teams and organizations are constantly seeking new ways to improve their efficiency and innovativeness. The key question is not only how to learn to work in an agile mode but even more, how to internalize the new and innovative mindset it requires. For example, how can we ensure all parties included really share the vision and feel motivated by it? Or, maybe we need to transfer useful but often boring and not very productive retrospective meetings into a solution-oriented collaboration event where learning and innovation takes place. </p>
						<p>Olli-Pekka and Eija will discuss in this presentation how this can be done by using modern virtual gaming approach.</p>

                        <p>Many of us agilists have started our careers as young programmers coding software for our own fun. Change from that position into an agile team delivering continuously value is not the small step to take. For me personally this has taken more than two decades.</p><p>
						In this presentation I will present key moments from my journey that helped me to learn to change from the programmer to the real agile developer. The goal is to both inspire you to think how you have learnt to change and how you could help others with this process </p>

						<hr>
						Esko Luontola: Continuous Delivery
						<p>Continuous Delivery is the capability of releasing your software to production at any time. It makes implemented features produce value sooner, provides faster feedback, lowers deployment risks etc. This presentation will tell you how to get started on Continuous Delivery in your projects.</p>
						<hr>
						Aleksis Tulonen: Exploratory Testing Explained
						<p>Exploratory Testing is something that is often misunderstood. It is actually an approach to testing that emphasizes testers ability to explore an unknown object or space through concurrent test design and test execution. While this may not say much to some of you, it is though something that all of us do when we are testing.</p>
						<p>In this talk I will discuss the fundamental idea behind exploratory testing and briefly go through sources of information that have helped me develop my understanding of it.  My objective is that after the talk you will have understanding about exploratory testing and you will also know where to find more information of it. </p>

						<hr>
						Ari Tanninen: Design Up Front in Back!
						<p>Working software is an expensive way of getting user feedback when compared with role-play or design prototypes.</p>
						<p>I will present practical examples from the domain of participatory and user-centered design in the context of product  and service development. These include various kinds of prototypes, role-play, design games, and simulations.</p>
						<p>The advantages of these methods include super-fast iterations, committed stakeholders, and ultimately better systems and cheaper IT acquisitions.</p>
						<hr>
						Niko Kurtti: From Pets to Cattle
						<p>Modern web applications needs to be always available and scalable to consistently changing user amounts and use cases. No matter how well your software has been designed you also need to have a well-designed server infrastructure to answer to these needs.</p>
						<p>This leads to a change in how we use and manage servers. Our server infrastructure should be as quickly and easily improved as software. No longer can we configure The server night before our system goes live and leave as it was for n years. </p>
						<p>So the answer? Make server infrastructure part of the software development. After all its services most of us are making, not code. The tools are there. Version control, automated provisioning, testing etc. From hand raised pets to identical cattle. Easily reproducible, replaceable and efficient.</p>

                        <p>What do we really do all day when we program or develop? How we do what we do, and why? Does it make any sense and if it does, to whom and in what way? What are the hardest challenges we face at our profession and how well we deal with them? Are we good at what we do?</p>
						<p>Based on my experience, a truly professional software engineer (a Programmer) is, for some reason, a rare creature. The serious lack of professionalism among the players in the SW field results in what we encounter every day: poor quality, late releases and lost opportunities.</p>
						<p>However, all hope it not lost. With some pride and commitment and by following some quite simple principles and practices, we can do a lot better. We have the power to make not only the stakeholders happier but also us developers more effective, successful and happy. </p>

                        <p>A large part of software developers in our community do contracting. Despite a number of interesting startups popping on the scene I do not see this trend ending anytime soon. The fundamental problem of contracting as it is done today is that the contractors are torn between serving their customers and serving their own companies.</p>
						<p>What causes this problem and how could it be solved? My argument is that it boils down to the contracting companies using the billing rate of contractors as the main indicator of success.</p>
						<p>This leads to a dynamic where spending the customer’s time and money is beneficial to the contractor in short term whilst simultaneously damaging the customer-contractor relationship in the long term.</p>
						<p>In my speech I’ll demonstrate this phenomenon in software contracting with concrete examples. I will also describe potential alternatives to how to lead and buy software contracting.</p>

                        <p>Our mental models play a central role in defining our everyday realities. In most of the little things we do every day, we simply think and act more or less automatically based on our internal concepts. </p>
						<p>It has been suggested, that our mental models are largely metaphorical. The way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day is very much a matter of metaphor. Our learning is also using metaphors to connect new concepts into existing ones.</p>
						<p>In this workshop we explore the effect of metaphors first in general, then exploring more carefully the metaphors of  software development. Finally, we work out what difference our choice of metaphor makes for our actions.</p>

                        <p>At Spotify, we believe that we will win if we can iterate on our product faster than the competition. If we can build our product faster, we can learn faster and thus improve & grow as a company faster than our competitors. We are growing rapidly to make this happen, but how do we ensure that our development teams are happy, high performing and constantly improving? How do we share these learnings with the rest of the business? One of the crucial roles in this endeavour are our Agile Coaches. In this talk, we will present what we believe an Agile Coach is, give some insight into the daily life of an Agile Coach at Spotify & explain why we believe that Agile Coaches help us win.</p>

                        <p>The #NoEstimates is the buzzword of the year 2013. There has been a lot of debate in Twitter and blogs whether we need estimates in software development and what might be an option. This talk will not continue that debate in the theoretical level. Instead, it will tell you a true story about a team that was initially spending 6 hours for sprint plannings but through different phases eventually realized being in a #NoEstimates way of working.</p>
