		</p>		
		<p> <strong> THEME 2015 </strong> is <em>*inspired beyond agile*</em>. What is agile but just Scrum? What is the challenge that we are trying to solve? 
		This year our theme and two keynote speakers, <a href="#BobMarshall">Bob Marshall</a> and <a href="#AllanKelly">Allan Kelly</a>, are asking us to think outside the canned methodology box – and get inspired.
		</p>
		<p>
		This year's program includes a change of location to <a href="http://www.rubyandfellas.fi/">Ruby &amp; Fellas</a> at the end of the talks. Please try to schedule so that you could be there to enjoy the atmosphere and program that continues.

						Agile software development methods have been around for a long time. Despite the changes we have

						</p><p>
						By know it has become clear that success of agile is not bound by the details of the method. 
						Organizations can’t change or improve by “doing agile” better. Fine tuning roles, practices or 
						ceremonies does not help.  Real leverage points for improvement are mostly elsewhere. It is about 
						time to broaden our thinking about what really constitutes a long-term success in organizations doing any kind of knowledge work.</p>

						<p>We at Ericsson Finland believe that broad knowledge and fast learning are the key elements for success. 
						With these elements we can more quickly react to changes and deliver value faster to our customers. Basic learning 
						methods like class room trainings are a good start, but we want more. Sense of community and involving 
						people is the future of learning – the Learning Lifestyle.
						</p><p>
						Learning Lifestyle encourages people by themselves define what they want to learn and what they want to share. 
						The goal is to get the people meet, the ones with the specific need and the ones with the specific knowledge. 
						Learning topics can be anything from technical ones such as Linux, C++ and Virtualization to soft topics like
						nutrition and mindfulness exercises. Learning opportunities vary from Tech Talks and class room trainings to 
						hands-on sessions and discussion groups. All topics are based on interests and needs coming from the people. 
						100 percent of participant have been happy and are looking for more.
						</p><p>

						<p>Pair programming is a core agile technical practice. Many people still have reluctance to pair, pair only 
						with people they choose, only on specific types of tasks or only in case of emergency. I am one of those 
						reluctant people pairing selectively. This talk is about deliberate practice in building up the skill of 
						pairing to allow pairing to take one’s skills on other activities to a new level.
						</p><p>
						In this session, you will learn about my different stages of pairing and lessons picked up as a testing specialist. 
						The talk goes through a growth patterns from pairing with peers (other testers) to pairing and mobbing with developers, 
						from traditional style and side-by-side work to strong-style pairing and to pairing on both testing and programming activities.
						</p><p>
						Join me on my journey to realize that explaining isn’t the same as experiencing. Pairing is sharing on a different level, 
						but to make the ride smooth, there’s skills to develop and styles to consider.</p>

						<p>In the ADVICeS project in &Aring;bo Akademi, we are examining the crossover between agile methods and critical-system development, 
						using the Event-B formal method. Event-B is a rigorous approach for modelling critical systems, supported by tools and a methodology. 
						The goal of modelling with Event-B is to increase confidence in a system's correctness, thereby improving quality.
						</p><p>
						Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is inspired by many agile techniques. We are using it as meta-analysis of current best-practice. 
						We are examining how DAD might influence Event-B, and assess its suitability for use in DAD projects.  We identify a number 
						of areas in which Event-B could be changed, and suggest how a different view of agile practices may be needed for a project
						that involving formal development of critical-systems.

						<p>&quot;You see, quality is just a cost and like other costs, it should be avoided or minimized.&quot; &quot;Testing, well isn&rsquo;t 
						it just another buffer in project&rsquo;s budget?&quot; &quot;Testers are not skilled labor, it&rsquo;s enough if they can read and 
						write.&quot; &quot;What automation? They can quickly click trough the app can&rsquo;t they?&quot; &quot;10 percent of development 
						effort is more than enough for any testing&quot; Sound familiar? As you know this is all wrong but a surprisingly common attitude 
						towards testing and quality. In my talk I go through the reasons and motivations behind the various attitudes that you can come across 
						when dealing with quality in software development. We&rsquo;ll explore these differences in views and how to best tackle them using the 
						right technology and right approach in a way you can make your customer happy and still keep your own sanity.
						</p><p>Good quality is the right tools for the right job. Just as you have to choose the correct tech stack 
						for the project, you need to choose the right set of QA tools for the job. One size fits all -solutions are evil.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#JuhaVuolle">Juha Vuolle</a>: Modern Companies</h3>
						<p>A decade ago agile and lean methodologies ignited drastic and permanent change in how we see software development. 
						The good old waterfall was let to dry and many established practices were replaced with nowadays commonplace techniques 
						such as test driven development, scrum, kanban, and so on. The most heated party has quieted down, some of the extremes 
						softened and a steady era of fit-for-purpose practices has been entered, still built on top of the agile principles.
						</p><p>
						The next shift in this trend is building entire companies on agile and
						lean ways of working. These new organisations go beyond being agile in individual projects or beyond flexible company restructuring.
						In analogy with replacing waterfall practices, we see telltale signs such as replacement of formal power hierarchies, loss of formal 
						job titles and an era of full transparency in reality. We see the  spirit of eager
						startup companies scaling up to big established players without losing
						much efficiency or gaining excessive fat.
						</p><p>
						In this talk I would like to invite you to hear about the underlying principles, some of the theory, my personal experiences 
						as a developer of both old and the new world, practical ways to get started, and discuss some of the big challenges.

							<h3><a href="#AllanKelly">Allan Kelly</a>: Beyond Projects</h3>
							<p>#NoProjects - Beyond Projects - why projects are wrong and what to do instead</p>
							<p>Good projects make for bad software. The defining feature of a project is an end date, 
							the defining feature of successful software is that it doesn't end. Software which is useful is 
							used and demands change, stop changing it and you kill it. At best the concept of a "Project" is 
							erroneously used for software development work. At worst the Project metaphor leads to dead software, 
							higher costs and missed business opportunities.</p>
							<p>In this talk Allan Kelly will attempt to justify this somewhat radical view, he will examine the project model 
							and show how it does not match software development.  He will then outline an alternative to the project model 
							and what companies need to do to achieve it.</p>
