		<p> <strong> THEME 2014 </strong> is <em>*We're all in this together*</em>. With this theme, we want to focus on collaboration and variety of skills we need in successful software development. </p>
		
		<p> Enrolling to the event is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zXtS8c_p15kWih7M8JYxb37oK1VLzrTyDVYvGRl88Y4/viewform?usp=send_form">now open</a>. </p>
		
		<p> This year's event will fit 140 participants. The event if free of charge and the enrollment will be done in two phases. The two phases are there to emphasize that we find the community - people's presence - in a conference like this of utmost value, and we would like people who enroll and confirm to actually be there. The discussions you can give to the others by being there is the reason we organize these! So welcome! </p>
		
		<p> This year's program includes a change of location to Teerenpeli at the end of the talks. Please try to schedule so that you could be there to enjoy the atmosphere and program that continues.</p>

							<p>Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming, where two people sit at the same computer and collaborate on the same code at the same time. With Mob Programming we extend the collaboration to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code. </p>
							
							<p>We strive to accentuate and amplify concepts such as face-to-face and side-by-side communication, team alignment, collaboration, whole team involvement, continuous code review, and the "self-organizing team", to name a few.</p>
							
							<p>I'll share why we work this way, our basic setup, how we work this way (including a few critical practices, such as the &quot;Driver/Navigators &quot; teamwork model that we use), and some of the benefits we have seen from Mob Programming.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#Woody">Woody Zuill & Llewellyn Falco</a>: Practical Refactoring Hands-On Workshop</h3>
						<p>Refactoring is easy; the theories have been written and even automated in your tools. Yet many of us still have to work every day with ugly code and large amounts of technical debt. When faced with large code bases, we feel unable to begin and often fall back to the old excuse &quot;that won&#39;t work here.&quot;</p>

						<p>It&#39;s time to get real. We are going to take a 300 line ball of mud, and show some new approaches and techniques so that you can actually start using those automated refactorings in your IDE to start safely changing your code little by little.  We will demonstrate:</p>
						<ul>
							<li> How to act without understanding the code</li>
							<li> Effective orders to act on code (do these before these)</li>
							<li> Emergent Design</li>
							<li> Small steps</li>
							<li> How to refactor without needing permission or budget</li>
						</ul>
						<p>As we go through the code understanding will emerge as well as a sense of calm and empowerment. We are going to be proving that every 2 minutes we have slightly better code, and that those series of small improvements will add up to massively better code.</p>

						<p>Overall, this will give a preview into what the effect of small daily improvements looks like over a few months of a much larger project, so you can see how starting on the path of continuous improvement will impact your own project at work.</p>

						<p> Software development is a team sport, where good design, coding, and testing are all needed to achieve a quality result. Out of these, especially the testing bit has often tried to be isolated to separate teams, phases, or individuals, often with problematic results. </p>
						<p>In this discussion track I share some of my good/bad experiences of trying to embed testing as a We activity, and invite participants to share their own experiences on it. Hopefully through this we can create a discussion from which we all can get something to nudge our teams a step toward the Brazil 1970 or Germany 2014 team composition. (note, as a bit of a fanatic, the track will likely contain same (or worse) kind of metaphors to football).</p>

                        <h3><a href="#Antti">Antti Kirjavainen</a>: Understanding Kanban through games 1/2: System of work, collaborative improvement</h3>
						<p> In this workshop, I will demonstrate how I use the &quot;Ball Flow Game&quot; by Karl Scotland to facilitate the understanding of systemic view of work and the collaborative improvement of work, which a a prerequisite to understanding Kanban.</p>

						<p>Understanding Kanban profoundly requires one to grasp a couple of principles about knowledge work that seem un-intuitive for many: Flow thinking and Continuous Improvement of ways of working through shared models and experimentation.</p>

						<p>In order to grasp these principles, the learner has to undergo a paradigm shift in how he thinks about knowledge work. This kind of paradigm shift requires more than reasoning or evidence based on logic. In order to overcome the cognitive conflict between his old thinking about work and theory and evidence on flow thinking, for instance, the learner needs something more.</p>

						<p>I have found out that one pedagogic method to help this paradigm shift is giving the learner the chance to experience these principles first hand through games and exercises. This practical experience serves as a point of reference to more theoretic discussion about the principles of Kanban. To have maximum effect, I use these games in the beginning of training sessions. </p>

						<p>The target audience for this session is two-fold. First, it can be used by people new to Kanban to grasp the basic principles through games and reflection after the games. Secondly, coaches, managers and facilitators who want to improve their Kanban introduction trainings and workshops with games can learn how to facilitate the games I introduce and learn how to use them to improve their Kanban trainings and workshops. </p>

						<p> Retrospectives are very important in a constantly improving organization, you should have them!" Ok, so you probably know the "why", but do you know the "how"? This workshop aims to give the very basic tools for succesfully facilitating a retrospective - structure, planning, activities etc. Whether inspecting a two-week sprint or a year long project, the basics remain the same. Warning; this might be a little on the lecture side, but I expect a lot of questions and promise some answers!</p>
