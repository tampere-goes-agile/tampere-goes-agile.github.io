		<p> <strong>THE THEME</strong> for Tampere Goes Agile 2016 is: Experimentation.</p>
		<p> Experimentation can be understood in many ways. For some, it might be about tools or methodologies, like DevOps, 
		helping you to find new ways for solving a technical issue. For some others, it could be about the Growth mindset 
		and how to build a culture of experimentation in your organization. For sure, it resonates with words like 'innovation', 'start-up', 'microservice' or 'hackathon'.

							<p>
							Some believe Agile is a mindset. Some believe you can't 'do Agile', you can only 'be Agile'. 
							Some believe Agile is a bunch of tools and processes. We run into trouble during Agile Transformations 
							when these beliefs collide with each other. Despite the difference in our beliefs, I think we can all 
							agree that we need to try some things out before knowing how Agile will affect our entire organization. 
							In this talk, I'll share techniques and stories about how to experiment your way through change. I'll 
							show you how to create experiments without losing sight of the big picture, and why you should use 
							fuzzy measurements early on when learning is the objective. Most importantly, instead of embracing 
							uncertainty, I'll show you how we can work towards reducing it.

							Finnish high schools experienced the biggest change in decades in fall 2016. The first digital matriculation exams (sähköinen ylioppilaskoe) were held after more than a century long history of traditional paper exams. This presentation reveals how experiments, highly agile goal based design and development, and choosing one's battles lead to a high stakes public sector, seemingly overnight deployment in more than 400 high schools.

							<h3><a href="#SamiPaju">Sami Paju</a>: Obstacles and pitfalls to experimentation in organisations</h3>

							Experimentation is not just limited to organisational units specifically tasked to develop new 
							products, services or internal processes. In a truly learning organisation, experimentation is 
							an everyday practice, linked to both continuous improvement and organisational renewal.
							</p><p>
							This presentation will walk you through the common obstacles and pitfalls that prevent experimentation 
							in organisations, while providing suggestions on what to do about them. The presentation is built on 
							top of research done in Aalto University in Finland, with Finnish organisations as case examples, and 
							the authors personal experience in training experimentation-driven development in a number of Finnish organisations.

							<p>
							We all know that refactoring is suppose to be the step that let's us tease apart the 
							logic of our code. 'Fake it till you make it' allows for us to evolve an emergent solution 
							to complex problems. Yet this is usually glossed over when showing Test Driven Development.
							</p><p>
							But not in this session. Here we are going to focus completely on Fake it till you make it. 
							Taking complex katas and reducing them to: 1 Red - 1 Green - 40 Refactors.
							</p><p>
							This talk is the result of taking a very small practice from agile and experimenting with 
							turning the dial up to 11.

							IT industry is not regulated. Software development projects use common sense to dodge the pitfalls of our practices. 
							I will tell my story - also as an undercover rebel. 
							</p><p>
							Fred Brooks told in 1975 in his book Mythical Man-Month that there 
							is no silver bullet because thinking is inherently difficult. We are designers who try to innovate. This is risky, not 
							predictable. I used agile practices like daily Scrums, cross-functional teams, team rooms and on-site customers in the 
							1980s. Barry Boehm introduced his risk oriented Spiral model in 1986. I tried user centric development and rapid 
							application development, RAD in the 1980s and 1990s. Outsourcing and COTS-products emerged since the industry was 
							struggling with the lack staff, especially programmers. Kent Beck brought the missing piece with his obsession to 
							testing. With XP practices we could finally deliver high-quality software fast. Monthly deliveries and acceptance test 
							driven development in 1990s got happy customers. Scrum won the methodology war by minting certified masters in two-day 
							classes. We have now a wider perspective of lean, agile, leadership and DevOps.

							<h3><a href="#AriPekkaLappi">Ari-Pekka Lappi</a>: How to have better technical fights?</h3>
							<p>
							One of the hardest thing in software development is how to disagree in technical decision in effective and constructive 
							way. Often the debates are pointless and energy consuming, or they are too conservative and, thus, leads no innovations and breakthroughs.
							</p><p>
							In this talk, I will discuss four efficient ways to build constructive technical debates.
							The intent of the talk is to provide tools and practices for more effective, mindful and constructive debate 
							on crucial technical decisions. The talk is targeted to senior software developers, architects, and other 
							persons who do technical coaching and mentoring (e.g. ScrumMasters having technical background).

							Small projects and big bang campaigns, tight deadlines, demanding customers. That’s what we are used

							approaching their marketing. Also briefing process has changed. There is a need to evolve and change 
							according to world around.
							</p><p>
							We have started experimenting different ways to utilize agile methods in mid-sized marketing agency, 
							Zeeland Family. Agile way of thinking is present not only in customer projects but also in organizing 
							the work and teams. We have started running agile experimentations in Zeeland Family Studio. Already in 
							6 months there has been a lot of improvements and many lessons learnt. The change is on-going and inevitable

							<p>
							Most of us have all been indoctrinated with the tenets of culture of planning some time or another. 
							Some part of us believes that thorough planning and analysis allows us to mitigate risks and seize opportunities.
							</p><p>
							Yet complexity theory states that planning and best practices do not work in the complex domain: solving 
							hard technical problems with integrating multiple technologies, providing the right UX for the customer 
							or fostering effective teams.
							</p><p>
							I’m going to run a Marshmallow Challenge workshop that demonstrates this in practice and gives insight what 
							we need to do in order to be effective in the complex domain. And how there is inherent complexity and 
							uncertainty even in tasks that seem pretty straightforward at first.
							</p><p>
							The purpose of this workshop session is to share a workshop format that will help people talk about the 
							differences of culture of planning and the culture of experimentation in concrete terms with their teams 
							and in their organization, whether it is about solving technical problems or fostering a company culture.

							<h3><a href="#DylanBeattie">Dylan Beattie</a>: Doing I.T. for SCIENCE! - Sprints, Startups and the Scientific Method</h3>
							<p>
							As developers, we're used to working with systems that we control. We write code, we write tests, we build servers and 
							infrastructure, and everything works beautifully - and then we ship, and suddenly we're not in control any more. Our code
							is out there in the real world - real people, real problems, maybe even real money - and suddenly we're seeing all sorts 
							of ​i​nteresting data and behaviour that was never part of our plan.
							</p><p>
							Agile teams aren't scared by this emergent behaviour - instead, we embrace it. We know that we don't really understand how 
							our systems work until we're getting real feedback from real users. We know that with rapid iterations and frequent releases, 
							we can react quickly to this feedback - but only once we understand what it really means. So... what's the best way to 
							investigate something that we don't yet understand?
							</p><p>
							Since the 17th century, scientists have been investigating the world around us using a technique known as the scientific 
							method - and, just like Tampere Goes Agile 2016, the scientific method is all about experimentation. So, in this talk, we're 
							going to talk about experiments. We'll discuss how to design a good experiment. We'll look at some of history's most famous 
							experiments, and how even 'failed' experiments have often led to important advances in knowledge and understanding. We'll 
							look at how successful software teams use experimentation as part of their development process, and at how you can share the 
							results of your own experiments so that we can all benefit from each other's research. And we'll even conduct a few experiments 
							of our own. You know... for <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">SCIENCE</a>!

					Jason began his career as a web developer when Cold Fusion roamed the earth. Over the following years, he moved into management, 
					Agile Coaching and consulting. The bumps and bruises collected along the way brought him to the realization that helping organizations 
					adopt Agile practices was less about the practices, and all about change.
					</p><p>
					In 2008 he attended an experiential learning conference about how people experience change and since then, he's been 
					writing, and speaking, all over the world about helping organizations discover more effective practices for managing 
					organizational change. He is the author of Lean Change Management and an international speaker who has spoken all over 
					the world from Canada, the US, Finland, Germany, Australia, Belgium and more.
