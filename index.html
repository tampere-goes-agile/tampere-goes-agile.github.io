		<p><strong>THE THEME</strong> for Tampere Goes Agile 2017 is: Alternatives to Established Agile Approaches.</p>
		<p>Sometimes organisations and teams adopt tools or frameworks without thinking why those tools emerged and were
        adopted in the first place. A method or a process can get so popular that people forget to ask themselves what
        problem this method was built to address, do we have this same problem and if so, how should we apply this method
        - or should we address this problem in a totally different way.
        </p>
        <p>This year we are returning to the essence of agile: inspect and adapt. We will share you talks and workshops
        on unique approaches emerged from learning in practice. We will share stories how organisations found their own
        solutions and not going with the obvious choice - or how the obvious choice turned out be something else.
		</p>
        <p>Our call for proposals is closed. Thanks for all the proposals, we'll get back to you soon!
	</p>
        <p>
        Our enrollment will open on 11.9.2017.
        </p>
        <p>We are looking for sponsors in order to keep this event free of charge, please see our

Adopted and tailored agile process, based on Scrum, Kanban and Futurice's Lean Service Creation. Great team spirit and cooperation with the customer has resulted into continuous delivery of successful results despite demanding, complex integrations.

             Technology is awesome! We can interact even we are separated by thousands of miles. Computers make us free from routines and do complicated calculations on behalf of us. But technology has also a dark side. It may become an impediment, make our work worse. Sometimes old trick is better than bag full of new apps.
             </p><p>
             Agile is built around collaboration, responsiveness and creating superb outcomes. Tools and practises are &quot;on the right side of the Agile Manifesto&quot;, they are necessary but not sufficient. Still many organisations try to improve by using new tools, new gadgets - new anything. And sometimes this prevents teams doing a good job.
             </p><p>
             We often solve problems by introducing a tool or process. This talk shows an alternative: what if we can become Agile by having *less* tools and processes?
             </p><p>
             This talk takes us back to the roots. It shows why low-tech is sometimes better and helps to understand when tools &amp; technology only hide problems rather than solving them. It also explores lo-fi alternatives that have helped individuals interact and explains how hi-tech can support teams when hi-tech is required."

             The Coaching Card is a simple but powerful template for ScrumMasters, line managers and Agile Coaches who are interested in coaching their teams to become more mature. (If you're not interested in that, you're probably in the wrong job.)
             </p><p>
             The Coaching Card is both a thinking model and a template. It gives some backbone to the coaching work, helps people choose the right interventions and gives a degree of measurability to the work. It also lets several people collaborate around one team and helps junior coaches get mentoring and advice from more experienced coaches. It's one of those simple things that people don't know they are missing, but look so obvious in hindsight.
             </p><p>
             Coaching Cards are based on the OODA loop (inspect and adapt) and on Karl Tomm's coaching model. It very specifically uses observations, hypotheses, goals, metrics and interventions. The Coaching Card concept has been developed over the last 5-6 years by agile42, by doing it and helping others do it. It's our own solution to a common practical problem, and it is unique because there are literally no other solutions to this problem out there. This presentation thereby fits nicely into the theme of TGA'17. It's obviously a coaching/people topic, not a technical topic.

						<h3><a href="#TeemuToivonen">Teemu Toivonen</a>: Agile fixed price projects</h3>
            <p>
             The de facto contract model for Agile is time &amp; materials. Fixed price projects come with a lot of package and most people have a gut reaction of "that's not Agile" when someone mentions fixed price models. This presentation challenges the myth and offers a practical approach for fixed prices that is arguably better than time &amp; material in many situations. The key building blocks are alternative ways for providing psychological security, managing risk and understanding the intangible aspects of customer value.

						<h3><a href="#VilleTormäla">Ville Törmälä</a>: Practice of maximizing the work not done</h3>
            <p>
            Continuous delivery, welcoming changing requirements, face-to-face conversation, sustainable pace etc. are all well covered topics in Agile Manifesto. They are quite clear and easy to understand, too.  But there one line that is not that obvious and also less discussed: "Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."
            </p><p>
            By looking at the industry as a whole, it seems that this advice has not been understood or followed widely. Problems are often solved by adding more code and features. Decorating ways of working are called improvements. Big and "complete" agile frameworks seem to have endless demand.
            </p><p>
            But world being complex is not a good excuse anymore. Doing more, adding more and making things more complex is easy. Anyone can do it. It takes much more to move into opposite direction.
            </p><p>
            Simplicity, minimalism and elegance have always been valued in science and arts. Some aims towards the same ideal are seen time to time in SW development, but too rarely. It's time to experiment more with less.
            </p><p>
            We need to understand the art of maximizing the work not done but also know what is the concrete practice. But not just for fun. It offers great potential for freedom, speed, reliability, predictability and focus. The very same things we have been trying to achieve but often without much success.

            <p>
             Agile needs to improve and evolve. However, instead of waiting for the next "Silver Bullet" framework or software tool to solve our development problems, we should first take a good look at ourselves. How do we cooperate, communicate, lead, envision, empathize, and lift each other? While process innovation is great, the Agile mousetrap is usually good enough. Our people practices need to evolve, too.

            <p>
             Agile process models do not target software security issues specifically, which has led to various complementary approaches such as Microsoft SDL for Agile. We believe that this is a bit misguided and the ideal way is to treat security as we treat other non-functional requirements like performance or  usability. We build it in during the normal development work. <br>We'll present issues and our solutions and some roadmap for the future on this talk. What sort of new tools and skills are required? What can you automate and how?  How to discuss security issues with the customer to integrate them to the workflow? How to teach the DevSec dance to your developers? Who else should take the  dance lessons?
