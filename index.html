                        <p>
                        Highly interactive programming languages provide developers with a remarkable ability to empower their creativity through a unique and highly responsive development process. This can be seen to broadly similar to the differences between the waterfall model and more recent agile approaches yet at an different timescale - that of moments vs minutes, rather than days vs weeks. Programming with an approach which allows one moment to flow frictionlessly to another without having to wait for compile cycles gives the developer a unique HyperAgile workflow which will be examined in detail in this talk.</p>

                        <p>The world is changing, crisis, businesses die, insecurity. Our workplace is changing fast as a consequence. We are asked to change constantly but given no method to do it. We need to have a framework that helps us adapt to the new environment. Agile provides us with a set of values and principles that can help us adapt, but what can we learn from Agile regarding work management? We need to look at the underlying principles of adaptation, how it works and it is already revolutionizing the work place. In this talk we set the road-map for that change and describe a method to get it done.</p>

                        <p>In 2005, when I started as the first functionality architect (or UI designer) at Reaktor, we had a lot of ideas but no experience of how to make UI design and agile methods work together in harmony. Today, tens of projects later, we have a set of established practises which seem to work. And of course we made all kinds of mistakes on the way which you could and should avoid.</p>
						<p>I'll be talking about how we do things today and what we've learned so far and - since we believe in constant change - what we think we'll do in the future. </p>

                        <p>Business Model Canvas, MVP, Pivot, XLM, continuous deployment. Many terms have been coined by the Lean Startup movement. Most of these practices radically change the way businesses do their job - making them more agile as a result. The idea is to make sure we are building the right thing. But what do I care as as a developer? I've noticed that on a daily basis, many "building the right thing" decisions are made when the team members play the implementation of the design by ear. Many interesting discoveries are often stumbled upon during this process. All of these small decisions have a huge impact on our capability to build and launch new products.</p>
						<p>In this talk I will explain why it is important for all the developers to have the "right" mindset. After all they are key people in making sure the ship is sailing in the correct direction at all times. All the small actions taken during the course are counted. I will share real cases, propose solutions and present pitfalls to avoid.</p>

                        <h3><a href="#emily">Emily Bache</a> - <span class="subject">Coding Dojo Challenge</span></h3>
                        <p>
                        In this hands-on session we will be looking at a rather smelly piece of code which needs a full set of automated tests so that it can be
                        refactored and extended with new functionality. It can be awkward to
                        express high level requirements in code, but in my experience test
                        readability is crucial for those tests being useful and maintainable
                        in the long term. We'll be stepping into the Coding Dojo together,
                        which is a safe place designed for learning, where it doesn’t matter
                        if we make mistakes. In fact all the code will be thrown away
                        afterwards. You should feel free to experiment, try out different
                        styles of test, and get feedback from your peers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        We're taking a simple, bounded problem, where the code basically
                        works, and the requirements are largely understood. The idea is to
                        practice your test design and refactoring skills, and have fun doing
                        it. We're trying to provoke that "aha!" experience where you realize
                        how much the tests are helping you understand the requirements and get
                        control of the code. There's a feeling of safety and freedom to
                        refactor then add new functionality, which once you've experienced
                        leaves you wanting more. This session could give you that extra bit of
                        motivation to get going writing good automated tests for your
                        production code.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The problem we'll be looking at is the "Gilded Rose" Refactoring Kata,
                        (see https://github.com/emilybache/Refactoring-Katas/tree/master/GildedRose).
                        For this session we'll be focussing on adding good readable tests to
                        the existing code, followed by refactoring leaning on those tests. The
                        Kata is available in various programming languages, including Java,
                        C#, Python and Ruby. You should bring a laptop with your favourite
                        coding environment or IDE installed, or plan to pair with someone.

                        <p>A product backlog should reflect our current view on how we want to build our product. Product Backlogs look deceptively simple, but the visible Product Backlog is in fact just the top of the iceberg. The true value lies below the surface and comes out of the communication while creating and working with it. In most cases people start building a backlog using their old mindset, and miss opportunities to identify better ways of building the product. The problem is that the knowhow you need to adopt new ways of working can only partially be gleaned from books: you really have to experience it on your own.</p>
						<p>In this hands-on session we will focus on the creation of a product backlog from scratch, to build a backlog collaboratively including its surrounding context of the product. In this session we will:
							<ul>
								<li>start at zero even before defining the idea by discovering the context first,</li>
								<li>nail down our idea to something that can give us direction,</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>Join me on the journey from defining the product idea to a backlog, to give you an impression on the unseen parts of the iceberg. Like the captain of the Titanic... prepare to be surprised!</p>

                        <p>How to understand the creative process if you have a degree in Engineering. Steve Jobs once joked that Engineers think Hollywood writers do their work by drinking beer and telling jokes (and that Hollywood thinks that building software is about writing a check). In reality creating software and creating art are more similar than they are different. The phenomenon of mass market software in the form of entertainment has blurred the lines even further. Making software has become much more like making movies than making machines. There are lessons to be learned from designers, marketers, managers and performers that all developers should learn.</p>

                        <p>Good testing helps to build a correct product: A talk about how testing can contribute to the building of the product using the right approaches compared to the less useful ways of testing. The talk will consist of multiple aspects from Exploratory testing to test automation, roles, etc. Testing can be done in multiple ways and part of successful testing is embracing the change and being agile.

Although changing the world one Scrum (or Kanban) project at a time is a good start, Martin is determined to rip up the industrial paradigm by the roots and replace it with something that makes sense in the software industry, preferably before next Friday (which would leave the weekend free). Most astonishingly, this plan has been in place unchanged for half a dozen years now, and must therefore be truly excellent.
